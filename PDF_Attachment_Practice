Operation Texonto
The attack chain:
Spam email with disinformation
phishing email purporting to be it at a known company containing a link to a bespoke and unique credential harvesting domain. Vibes a lot like Callisto.

Rule based on email content:

#CredTheft nlu -- is ukrainian language supported by the nlu? #It's not -- give up.
type.inbound
and any([body.plain.raw, body.html.inner_text], 
        any(ml.nlu_classifier(.).intents,
            .name == "cred_theft" and .confidence == "medium"
        )
)

#Fake IT
type.inbound
//Shady new domain from an email purporting to be IT...
and strings.istarts_with(sender.email.email == "it.")
and sender.email.domain.domain in $free_email_providers

//...but it sure as heck isn't and IT department WE know.
//New domain who dis
and any(body.links,

    .href_url.domain.root_domain not in $tranco_1m
    or (
        // free subdomain URL
        .href_url.domain.subdomain is not null
        and .href_url.domain.subdomain != "www"
        and .href_url.domain.root_domain in $free_subdomain_hosts
    )
)
//Negate trusted senders
and (
    (
      sender.email.domain.root_domain in $high_trust_sender_root_domains
      and (
        any(distinct(headers.hops, .authentication_results.dmarc is not null),
            strings.ilike(.authentication_results.dmarc, "*fail")
        )
      )
    )
    or sender.email.domain.root_domain not in $high_trust_sender_root_domains
  )
