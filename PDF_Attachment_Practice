Operation Texonto
The attack chain:
Spam email with disinformation
phishing email purporting to be it at a known company containing a link to a bespoke and unique credential harvesting domain. Vibes a lot like Callisto.

Rule based on email content:
#Spam

#Fake IT

#Malicious link with a lot of unique variables

#malicious/young domain containing "microsoft"

#IT department language with link leading credential requiring page
