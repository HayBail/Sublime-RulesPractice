  According to ESET Research on February 21, 2024, malicious activity tracked under the identifier 
  Operation Texonto "targeted a Ukraininan defense company in October 2023 and an EU Agency in November 2023" for
  the purpose of Microsoft Office 365 credential harvesting. The October 2023 emails purported to be from the IT department 
  of the company and sent Ukrainian language emails containing a link to a fake microsoft domain.
  After interaction, this link likely redirected to the legitimate office365 webpage.
